1.1 Usage and Other Charges. 
You may use utilities only for normal household purposes and must not waste them. If your electricity is interrupted, you must use only batteryoperated lighting (no flames). You must not allow any utilities(other than cable or Internet) to be cut off or switched for any reasonÃ¢â‚¬â€�including disconnection for not paying your billsÃ¢â‚¬â€�until the Lease term or renewal period ends. You must connect utilities in your name and you must notifythe provider of your move-out date so the meter can be timely read. If you delay getting it turned on in your name by the LeaseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s start date or cause it to be transferred back into our name before you surrender or abandon thedwelling, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be liable for a $__________ charge (not to exceed $50 per billing period), plus the actual or estimated
cost of the utilities used while the utility should have been billed to you. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in an area open to competition andyour dwelling is individually metered, you may choose or change your retail electric provider at any time. If you qualify,
your provider will be the same as ours, unless you choose a different provider. If you do choose or change your provider,you must give us written notice.

After the property is removed, a written notice of entry must be left in a conspicuous place in the dwellingÃ¢â‚¬â€�including a list of items removed, the amount of delinquent rent due, and the name, address, and phone number of the person to contact. The notice must also state that the property will be promptly returned when the delinquent rent is fully paid.

(3). Failing to Pay First MonthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rent. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pay the first monthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rent when or before the Lease begins, all future rent for the Lease term will be automatically accelerated without notice and become immediately due. We also may end your right of occupancy and recover damages, future rent, reletting charges, attorneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fees, court costs, and other lawful charges. Our rights, remedies and duties under Par. 10 and 32 apply to acceleration under this paragraph.
